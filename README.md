# lightcurve-cnn

This project explores a method for classifying variable stars using light curve data from the [OGLE experiment](https://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/). The challenge lies in handling irregular sampling and missing data across light curves, which makes traditional classifiers ineffective.

To address this, we transform light curves into images and use Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to classify them based on patterns in their flux over time.

## Methods
- CNN-based classification
- Image transformation of light curves
- Evaluation on a test dataset
- Creating 2D data visualizations 

## Data Source
- OGLE Variable Star Catalog

## Notes
This work was completed as a final project for ASTR21100 Winter 2025 at The University of Chicago. The CNN method provides promising results for classification of variable stars in the presence of noisy, irregular data.
